Introduction to the project Our course project, Guardian on Wrist, aims to provide a watch-based proactive healthcare solution for the elderly in post pandemic era. Our goal is to design and prototype this product with enough functions that can deal with typical potential health threats in daily life. The prototyping process is divided into the phrases according to the course arrangement. At the first phrase, or what we called early design stage, we started from the initial idea, obeyed the four step of regular design procedure (Empathize, Interpret, Ideate, Verify) and eventually settled down the main functions and three major using cases.</description>

      <description>Poster in Phase II
In Essay I, I’ve mentioned that applying smart speaker as the central controller of the smart furniture may mass up everything when speaker misunderstands humans’ commands and send out wrong instructions to other furniture. For users, sometime it’s hard to withdraw these misunderstood commands, which might cause irreversible damage and even mass up everything. However, as I go deeper into this product, I have a better understand of this product, which leads to a change of the topic.</description>

      <description>Poster in Phase I
Nowadays, we are increasingly inseparable from the smart speaker.
